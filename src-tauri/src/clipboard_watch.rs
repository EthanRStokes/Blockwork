//! Background service that fires `WhenClipboardChanged` strands on their own,
//! independent of Run/Loop — see `battery_watch`'s module doc for why (same
//! mechanism, same reasoning, just a clipboard-content condition instead of a
//! battery one). Polls the clipboard on a timer and fires a strand's body
//! directly (skipping its header) the moment its contents differ from the
//! last poll.
//!
//! Only the currently selected macro's strands are watched, plus any macro
//! whose `MacroSettings::always_listen` is set — see `battery_watch`'s module
//! doc for the same scoping rule.
//!
//! Unlike the battery watcher's threshold-crossing hysteresis, there's no
//! condition to recover past here — any difference from the previous poll's
//! fingerprint fires. A strand's very first observation only records a
//! baseline rather than firing, so opening a macro that's always had *some*
//! clipboard content doesn't immediately fire just because this watcher has
//! never looked before.
